    <h1>Who am I and what is my food truck about ?</h1>
    <section class="intro">
        <p>Hello, my name is Pedro Alvàrez, a well-known chef specialized in Mexican cuisine and I am proud to present
            to you, “El Hombre Loco!”<br><br>
            “El Hombre Loco” is a food truck about Mexican food, with typicals meals such as tacos, quesadillas,
            enchilada and much more, customers can travel to Mexico throughout the meals i made with love, with fresh
            and high-quality products! <br><br>
            The name "El Hombre Loco", which means "The Crazy Man", comes from the fact that Mexican food is mostly
            spicy, so spicy that it will drive you insane! </p>

    <h1>My story</h1>

    <section class="histoire">
        <img src="images/image_enfant.jpeg" alt="photo enfant chef pedro alvarez">
        <p>Since I was a child, my passion has always been food, especially cooking, I express myself through cooking.
            <br><br>
            When I was a teenager, I went to Mexico for vacations, I really liked the country, especially the food
            there, the tortillas, the quesadillas and the spices, when I came back from this trip, my passion for
            cooking had grown, and I decided to study food-related subjects to deepen it. <br><br>
            That’s also when the idea of making a mexican based food truck hit me. My motto is to share my passion of
            cooking and the mexican culture with the customers.</p>
